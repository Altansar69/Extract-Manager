## ‚ùì FAQ  

- **Why administrator privileges?**  
  Only required for registering/unregistering the Windows context menu.  

- **Where are passwords/settings stored?**  
  In `passwords.json` and `appsettings.json`, next to `ExtractManager.exe`.  

- **Which archive formats are supported in the context menu?**  
  `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.gz`.  

- **Is Import/Export safe?**  
  Yes, passwords are encrypted before export.  

- **Why 7-Zip and SharpCompress?**  
  SharpCompress is used to bootstrap extraction if 7-Zip is not available. 7-Zip is faster, so it‚Äôs preferred once installed.
